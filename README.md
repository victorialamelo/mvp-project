### Objective: The main goal of this app is to allow users to create and save schedules with planned itineraries on Google Maps. Users can also share these itineraries with others. While the Google Maps app currently allows users to access past itineraries, it does not provide the ability to save future itineraries, which is where this website can be useful.
### Technologies used:
- Frontend: React, Vite, CSS, HTML
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MySQL, MySQL Workbench
- API Testing & Development: Postman
- Third-Party APIs: Google Maps API
